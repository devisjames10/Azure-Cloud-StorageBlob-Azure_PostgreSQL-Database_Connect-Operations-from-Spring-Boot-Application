# Azure-Cloud-StorageBlob-Azure_PostgreSQL-Database_Connect-Operations-from-Spring-Boot-Application
How to use the Spring Boot Starter for Azure Storage and Azure PostgreSQL, using the client library for Java and Maven dependency.

This application has been built using azure-storage-spring-boot-starter and Azure postgresql database maven dependency to connect to the Azure storage blob data and Azure cloud postgresql database. It can download the blob json database property file from azure blob stirage using container name and blob name, then application will read the downloaded database property file and will use the property filr to connect to Azure PostgreSQL database to perform some database operations. In order to do the same, we have set up run configuration property to auto feed application startup(Azure details like key, storage account name, protocol, container name, blob name etc.), please find the attached image for the same. Also find the json property file attached with this respiratory that will contain database connection properties.
